Also [available for Atom](https://github.com/Vild/atomize-d)!

## Features

* Autocompletion
* Code formatting
* Static linting
* Outlining and searching for symbols

## Installation

### Dependencies:

Code-d needs its backend, [workspace-d](https://github.com/Pure-D/workspace-d). Go there and follow the installation instructions.
Installing it will automatically detect or install the necessary D tools 
([dcd](https://github.com/Hackerpilot/DCD), [dfmt](https://github.com/Hackerpilot/dfmt), [dscanner](https://github.com/Hackerpilot/Dscanner)).

### Code-d installation

This assumes [workspace-d](https://github.com/Pure-D/workspace-d) is already installed.

* Automatic:
  Open Visual Studio Code and install _code-d_ extension the normal way:

  ```
  ext install webfreak.code-d
  ```

* Manual (if the automatic way doesn't work)

    ```
    cd ~/.vscode/extensions/
    git clone https://github.com/Pure-D/code-d.git
    cd code-d
    npm install
    node ./node_modules/vscode/bin/compile
    ```
